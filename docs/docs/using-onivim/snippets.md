Snippets are text templates that simplify entering code patterns,
and are especially useful for code blocks that show up repeatedly.

# TODO: Gif

Onivim shows available snippets along with completion items.

The snippet syntax follows the [Code Snippet Syntax](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax) (which is a subset of the [TextMate Snippet Syntax](https://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets)). In addition, Onivim supports many of the same configuration options as Visual Studio code.

## Using snippets

When a snippet is available in the completion, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> will expand the snippet.

While a snippet is active, the mode will show `Snippet` in the sidebar. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> while a snippet is active will move the cursor to the next placeholder, while pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> will move to the previous placeholder.
